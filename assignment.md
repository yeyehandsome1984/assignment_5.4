## Assignment

### Brief

In this assignment, create a mobile app demonstrate the use of another external package from the Expo SDK. You can pick any SDK component available in the library.

https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/

You may also use components from other React Native libraries, but make sure that these 
have been verified to work in the Expo environment. 

Your demo can be based on sample code provided in the documentation, but add your
own customisation and comments to into the code to help you understand how the 
component works.

This will be helpful for your capstone project.
